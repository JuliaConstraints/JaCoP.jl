# JaCoP.jl

JaCoP.jl is a wrapper for the [JaCoP constraint-programming solver](https://github.com/radsz/jacop).

JaCoP.jl only proposes an implementation of the interface defined by 
[MathOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl) and by
[ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl).
It does not provide access to the low-level Java API.

*Note: This wrapper is maintained by the community and is not officially supported by the JaCoP project.
If you are interested in official support for JaCoP in Julia, let them know!*
